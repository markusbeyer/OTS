# OTS (Operative Travel Security System)

OTS is a security system for travelling.

It monitors an "Operator" (user who is travelling) while travelling by waiting for messages within foredefined time windows. It logs messages throughout the journey and responds if time windows are missed by reminding, contacting friends or family and - eventually - the police.

Thereby it can provide basic security for any traveller on a journey.

## Installation

Will update this soon.

## Usage

Open it with the Python Interpreter. It will run you through the setup and then start with your configured settings. Let it run while doing your travels - and message it via email whatever you want it to do.

Also supports SPOT devices as long as you configured the email.

Will update this soon.
